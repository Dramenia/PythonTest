Test for interview

The current project is a modbus device (server) that generates a random number.
The client connects to the server and pulls the value from the device.

Make the client multi-threaded so that it:
- pulls data from the device every 200 ms
- calculate the average of the past 1 minut and 15 minutes
- create api to request the data (up to you how)

if you have questions, let me know.
